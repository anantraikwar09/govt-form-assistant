Built by a 1st-year Engineer with the help of Google's Gemini AI.
👨‍💻Credits & Acknowledgments
This project was a collaborative effort, and I want to extend credit to the following:

Gemini (Google AI): This project was developed with significant assistance from Gemini. From architecting the document processing pipeline and implementing complex "Lookaround Regex" for OCR noise reduction, to debugging Streamlit UI components, the AI served as a primary mentor and technical guide.

Project Team: I would like to acknowledge my team members for their support throughout the duration of this project.

Development Tools: Special thanks to the developers of Streamlit, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR, which provided the technical foundation for this application.

🎓My Learning Journey
I am currently a 1st-year Engineering student (1st Semester). At the start of this project, my technical background was limited to basic Python and logic, with very little knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) or advanced image processing.

What I Learned:
AI-Human Collaboration: I learned how to use Generative AI to bridge the gap between "knowing a language" and "building a full-scale application."

OCR & Regex: I gained a deep understanding of how to handle messy, real-world data from Indian ID cards, specifically using Lookaround Regex to solve the VID (Virtual ID) extraction problem.

UI/UX with Streamlit: I learned how to turn a backend script into a professional web application with file upload and download capabilities.


Problem Solving: I learned how to break down a complex requirement—like the "Indian Citizen Services Assistant"—into smaller, manageable technical modules.

This project has been an incredible learning experience. While I don't know everything yet, this journey has inspired me to dive deeper into DSA and software architecture. I am committed to continuing my learning and building even more impactful tools in the future.
